## Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: 
- one slot for each hand
- two slots for their belt
- a backpack with six slots

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. 
Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the GMs discretion.

__Bulky__ items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.  
  
__Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.__

Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings or companions can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:

- Three days' rations (one slot)
- A torch (one slot)
- 3d6 gold pieces

Roll once on each of the **Starting Gear** tables to determine your PC's armor, weapons and equipment. Pick only one item for each result.

See the **Equipment List** for related armor, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.
