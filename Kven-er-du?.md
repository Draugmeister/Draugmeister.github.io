# Your Character

## Who Are You?

Roll 3d6 for each __Ability Score__. 10 is average. 

__Strength__ – Fighting, fortitude, and toughness.  
__Dexterity__ – Stealth, athletics, and reflexes.  
__Willpower__ – Confidence, discipline, and charisma.  

Characters start with d6 __Hit Points__, a measure of their ability to avoid life-threatening Damage.

## Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: 
- one slot for each hand
- two slots for their belt
- a backpack with six slots

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. 
Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the GMs discretion.

__Bulky__ items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.  
  
__Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.__

Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. Hirelings or companions can also be paid to carry equipment.

## What Do You Have?

You start with D6 silver.

Match your highest __Ability Score__ against your __Hit Points__ to find your starting package. Weapons have their damage roll listed. If two characters would have the same equipment, the second character takes their starting package from the column to the left, or right if this is not possible.
