# Rules Summary  

**Die of Fate**  

If something is uncertain in the fiction, the GM may ask you to roll a D6 to get answers.

__4-6__ It's something nice, helpfull or advantageus.  
__2-3__ It's something potentially bad.  
__1__ It's not good at all. 

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.   
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.   
**WIL:**  Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**  
- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment's rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

**SPELLBOOKS**
Spellbooks contain a single spell and take up one item slot. Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. Casting a spell adds **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory.

Given time and safety, PCs can enhance a spell without any additional cost. If they are deprived or in danger, a WIL save may be required to avoid terrible consequences.

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the [**Scars**](/cairn-srd#scars-1) table.
 
Damage that reduces a target's HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.**  Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.

**STRESS**
When your Lilliputian experiences grave danger or bizarre events, make a WIL Save. On a failure, the character suffers WIL damage. The amount of damage will vary depending on how extreme the circumstances were.  
• Mild or upsetting events: 1 damage to WIL  
• Strange and unsettling occurrences that cause one to gasp: d4 damage to WIL  
• Challenging encounters that inspire fear or pose a real threat: d6 damage to WIL  
• Monster battles and losing a friend: d8 damage to WIL  
• Experiences of horror, Leviathans from the deeps: d10 damage to WIL  

**Pivotal Moment**
When WIL is reduced to 0, characters experience a Pivotal Moment. See the Pivotal Moment table and cross-reference the damage dealt to reduce WIL to 0 and take the consequence.

**Cling to what you hold dear…**
If a character experiences stress, they can choose
an item they are carrying and use it as a totem of
comfort. If you do this for a Long Rest, this item is
now your Cherished Possession

**Recovering from the Horrors**  
A Lilliputian can recover d6+1 WIL by holding the Cherished Possession for a Short Rest or restore
max WIL resting for a Full Rest on land. WIL cannot be restored without a Cherished Possession. If lost, a new item can become a Cherished Possession after d3+1 Long Rests.

## SCARS
When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:

|      |                                                              |
|------ |---|
| 1    | Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 2    | Rattling Blow: You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 3    | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP. |
| 4    | Broken Limb: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 5    | Diseased: You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 6    | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current ability score, take the new result. |
| 7    | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result. |
| 8    | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4. |
| 9    | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result. |
| 10   | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Warden will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6. |
| 11   | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP. |
| 12   | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

## STRESS OUTCOMES
| Damage to WIL | Pivotal Moment                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
