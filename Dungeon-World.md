# Dungeon World

Me bruker Dungeon World som grunnleggande system, med nokre endringar. 

Dei største endringane frå Dungeon World:
- __Ingen klassar__. Bakgrunnen din bestemmer berre kva du byrjer med.
- __Skaden din kjem frå våpenet ditt__, ikkje klassen din (det er jo ingen klassar).
- __Ingen moves som er avgrensa til klassar__. Me finn eller lager moves som høver narrativet.
- __Berre modifiers på stats__. I staden for å ha til dømes 12 STR (+1) har du berre +1 STR.
- __Perilous Wilds__(eit suplement til DW) sine reglar for ekspedisjonar, slå leir og å rekrutera følgjarar (er implmentert i lista med moves).


### Kort om Dungeon World:

> __Playing Dungeon World means having a conversation;__ somebody says something, then you reply, maybe someone else chimes in. We talk about the fiction—the world of the characters and the things that happen around them.
>
> As we play, the rules will chime in, too. They have something to say about the world. There are no turns or rounds in Dungeon World, no rules to say whose turn it is to talk. Instead players take turns in the natural flow of the conversation, which always has some back-and-forth. The GM says something, the players respond. The players ask questions or make statements, the GM tells them what happens next. Dungeon World is never a monologue; it’s always a conversation.
>
> __The rules help shape the conversation of play.__ While the GM and the players are talking, the rules and the fiction are talking, too. Every rule has an explicit fictional trigger that tells you when it is meant to come into the conversation. Like any conversation, the time you spend listening is just as important as the time you spend talking. The details established by the other people at the table (the GM and the other players) are important to you: they might change what moves you can make, set up an opportunity for you, or create a challenge you have to face.
>
> __The conversation works best when we all listen, ask questions, and build on each other’s contributions.__

### Moves

# Basic moves

-----

## Hack and Slash

When you *__attack an enemy in melee__*, roll
+STR: on a 10+, you deal your damage to the
enemy and avoid their attack, unless you
choose to do +1d6 damage and expose yourself
to their attack; on a 7–9, you deal your
damage to the enemy and the enemy makes
an attack against you.

----

## Volley

When you *__take aim and shoot at an enemy at
range__*, roll +DEX: on a 10+, you have a clear
shot—deal your damage; on a 7–9, deal your
damage and choose one:
- You have to move to get the shot, placing
yourself in danger (ask the GM how)
- Take what you can get: -1d6 damage
- You have to take several shots, reducing
your ammo by one

----

## Defy Danger

When you *__act in the fact of imminent threat
or calamity__*, say what you do and roll...  

... +STR if you power through  
... +DEX if you act fast  
... +CON if you endure  
... +INT if you think fast  
... +WIS if you steel your will  
... +CHA if you charm your way out  

On a 10+, you do it, and the threat doesn’t
come to bear; on a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate,
or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse
outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

----

## Defend

When you *__stand in defense of a person, item,
or location under attack__*, roll +CON: on a 10+,
hold 3; on a 7–9, hold 1. As long as you stand
in defense, when you or the thing you defend
is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to
choose an option:
- Redirect an attack from the thing
you defend to yourself
- Halve the attack’s effect or damage
- Open up the attacker to an ally
giving that ally +1 forward against
the attacker
- Deal damage to the attacker equal
to your level

----

## Spout Lore

When you *__consult your accumulated knowledge
about something__*, roll +INT: on a 10+,
the GM will tell you something interesting
and useful about the subject relevant to your
situation; on a 7–9, the GM will only tell you
something interesting—it’s on you to make it
useful. The GM might ask you “How do you
know this?” Tell them the truth, now.

----

## Discern Realities

When you *__closely study a situation or person__*,
roll +WIS: on a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions
from the list below; on a 7–9, ask 1. Either
way, take +1 forward when acting on the
answers.

- What happened here recently?
- What is about to happen?
- What should I be looking out for?
- What here is useful or valuable?
- Who’s really in control here?
- What here is not as it appears?

----

## Parley

When you *__have leverage on an NPC or monster
and manipulate them__*, roll +CHA: on a
10+, they do what you ask if you first promise
what they ask of you; on a 7-9, they will do
what you ask, but need some concrete assurance
of your promise, right now.

----

## Aid or Interfere

When you *__help or hinder someone__*, roll +bond
with them: on a 10+, they take +1 or -2 to
their roll, your choice; on a 7–9, they still get
a modifier, but you also expose yourself to
danger, retribution, or cost.

----

# Special Moves

----

## Last Breath

When *__you’re dying__*, roll +nothing: on a 10+,
you’ve cheated Death—you’re in a bad
spot but you’re still alive; on a 7–9, Death
himself will offer you a bargain—take it
and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the
Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you; on
a 6-, your fate is sealed. and you’ll cross the
threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

----

## Encumbrance

When you *__make a move while carrying
weight__*, you may be encumbered. If your
weight carried...

... does not exceed your load, you suffer no
penalty.

... exceeds your load by no more than 2, you
take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden.

... exceeds your load by 3 or more, drop at
least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically
fail.

----

## End of Session

When you *__reach the end of a session__*, choose
one bond that you feel is resolved, ask the
player of the character you have the bond
with if they agree; if they do, mark XP and
write a new bond with whomever you wish.

Then, if you fulfilled your alignment at least
once this session, mark XP. Then, answer
these questions together:

- Did we learn something new and important
about the world?
- Did we overcome a notable enemy?
- Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For each “yes,”everyone marks XP.

----

## Carouse

When you *__return triumphant and throw a big
party__*, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every
extra 100 coins spent: on a 10+, choose 3; on a
7–9, choose 1; on a 6-, choose one, but things
get out of hand (ask the GM how).

- You befriend a useful NPC
- You hear rumors of an opportunity
- You gain useful information
- You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked

----

## Supply

When you *__go to buy something__*, you can buy
it at market price if it’s readily available. If
it’s something special, roll +CHA: on a 10+,
you find it, at a fair price; on a 7–9, you’ll
have to pay more,jump through some jhoops,
or settle for something that’s not exactly
what you wanted (ask the GM which).

----

## Recover

When you *__do nothing but rest in comfort and
safety__*, after a day of rest you recover all your
HP. After three days of rest you remove one
debility of your choice. If you’re under the
care of a healer, you heal a debility for every
two days of rest instead.

----

## Outstanding Warrants

When you *__return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before__*, roll +CHA: on a 10+, word has spread of your deeds and
everyone recognizes you; on a 7–9, as above,
and the GM chooses a complication:

- The local constabulary has a warrant outfor your arrest
- Someone has put a price on your head
- Someone important to you has been put
in a bad spot as a result of your actions

----

## Bolster

When you *__spend your leisure time in study,
meditation, or hard practice__*, you gain
preparation. If you prepare for a week or
more, take 1 preparation. If you prepare for
a month or longer, take 3 instead. When
your preparation pays off, spend 1 preparation
for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one
preparation per roll.
