# Dungeon World

Me bruker Dungeon World som grunnleggande system, med nokre endringar. 

Dei største endringane frå Dungeon World:
- __Ingen klassar__. Bakgrunnen din bestemmer berre kva du byrjer med.
- __Skaden din kjem frå våpenet ditt__, ikkje klassen din (det er jo ingen klassar).
- __Ingen moves som er avgrensa til klassar__. Me finn eller lager moves som høver narrativet.
- __Perilous Wilds__(eit suplement til DW) sine reglar for ekspedisjonar, slå leir og å rekrutera følgjarar (er implmentert i lista med moves).


### Kort om Dungeon World:

> __Playing Dungeon World means having a conversation;__ somebody says something, then you reply, maybe someone else chimes in. We talk about the fiction—the world of the characters and the things that happen around them.
>
> As we play, the rules will chime in, too. They have something to say about the world. There are no turns or rounds in Dungeon World, no rules to say whose turn it is to talk. Instead players take turns in the natural flow of the conversation, which always has some back-and-forth. The GM says something, the players respond. The players ask questions or make statements, the GM tells them what happens next. Dungeon World is never a monologue; it’s always a conversation.
>
> __The rules help shape the conversation of play.__ While the GM and the players are talking, the rules and the fiction are talking, too. Every rule has an explicit fictional trigger that tells you when it is meant to come into the conversation. Like any conversation, the time you spend listening is just as important as the time you spend talking. The details established by the other people at the table (the GM and the other players) are important to you: they might change what moves you can make, set up an opportunity for you, or create a challenge you have to face.
>
> __The conversation works best when we all listen, ask questions, and build on each other’s contributions.__

### Moves

# Basic moves

-----

## Hack and Slash

When you *__attack an enemy in melee__*, roll
+STR: on a 10+, you deal your damage to the
enemy and avoid their attack, unless you
choose to do +1d6 damage and expose yourself
to their attack; on a 7–9, you deal your
damage to the enemy and the enemy makes
an attack against you.

----

## Volley
When you *__take aim and shoot at an enemy at
range__*, roll +DEX: on a 10+, you have a clear
shot—deal your damage; on a 7–9, deal your
damage and choose one:
- You have to move to get the shot, placing
yourself in danger (ask the GM how)
- Take what you can get: -1d6 damage
- You have to take several shots, reducing
your ammo by one
